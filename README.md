# Decoupled Drupal with Ember
A presentation about decoupled Drupal as a JSON API back end for Ember applications.

## Abstract
The Ember community describes its flagship framework as an "SDK for the web." Why has Ember captured the imagination of so many front-end developers involved in building single-page applications? Ember is an opinionated JavaScript framework which values convention over configuration â€” that is, a common set of practices rather than explicit settings. For this reason, Ember has significant advantages over other common JavaScript frameworks due to its large extent of standardization, including a codified directory structure for all applications (simplifying on-boarding) and a clear and interoperable approach to templating.

Not solely because of its open-source ethos and welcoming community, Ember is a prime candidate to develop Drupal-backed JavaScript applications due to its reach, its coverage, and its ease of use. Join me as we explore the inner workings of Ember, foundational concepts of Ember's ecosystem, how to decouple Drupal with an Ember front end, and what the future could bring in terms of more Ember within Drupal.
